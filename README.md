# UCS654 Predictive Analysis Using Statistics
## Assignment-1
## Learning Probability Density Functions using Roll-Number-Parameterized Non-Linear Model

# 1. Introduction
``` text
 This assignment focuses on understanding probability density functions by working with real air quality data. A nonlinear mathematical transformation is applied to the data, and the parameters of the resulting distribution are learned. To make each student’s work unique, the transformation is defined using the university roll number.
